       "  ('a frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. by a large margin, an associated_press poll in 1950 named bill_tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century. from 1920 to 1930, tilden won singles titles at wimbledon three times and the_u.s._championships seven times. in 1938, however, donald_budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the grand_slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. tilden called budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\" and in his 1979 autobiography, jack_kramer said that, based on consistent play, budge was the greatest player ever. some observers, however, also felt that kramer deserved consideration for the title. kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. tony_trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era, kramer was the best male champion. a break point occurs if the receiver, not the server, has a chance to win_the game with the next point. break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. a receiver who has one (score of 30-40 or advantage), two (score of 15-40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win_the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. if the receiver does, in fact, win_their break point, the game is awarded to_the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their break point. if the receiver fails to win_their break point it is called a failure to convert. winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. if in_the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back. except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.
